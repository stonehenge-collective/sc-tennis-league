## How to Record a Match

Follow these simple steps to record a match and have the rankings updated automatically.

2. **Fill in the Details**:
    - **Title**: Do what you will.
    - **Match date**: The date the match was played (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
    - **Players**: The GitHub handles of the two players, separated by a comma. **The winner must be listed first.** (e.g., `@winner, @loser`)
    - **Sets**: The score of each set, one per line. The winner's score must be listed first. (e.g., `6-3`)
3. **Submit the Issue**: Click "Submit new issue".
4. **Review and Approve the PR**: A bot will create a pull request (PR) with the match data and link to this PR from the issue. The two players involved will be requested to review it.
5. **Merge the PR**: Once the PR is approved, it can be merged. On merge an action will be triggered that will update the rankings.csv file.
6. **Merge the PR**: Another PR will be opened that will update the rankings.csv file. You will need to merge this PR as well. Upon merge the leaderboard will be updated.

## Terminology and Rules

This section defines core terms and documents the current behavior so contributors and players share the same mental model.

- **Match**: A single github issue representing one play session. A match will contain some number of sets.
- **Set**: A line in the issueâ€™s Sets block, e.g., `6-4`. The winner is the side with the higher games on that line.
- **Game**: The tennis unit within a set.

### Current ELO behavior

- Ratings are based on individual sets. If a Match contains multiple sets, each set contributes an ELO update independently.
- Score margin (e.g., 6â€‘0 vs 6â€‘5) does not change the ELO delta; only who won the set matters.
- Player rankings are calculated using the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).
