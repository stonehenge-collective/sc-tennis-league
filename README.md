[![leaderboard](https://github.com/stonehenge-collective/tennis/actions/workflows/pages-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stonehenge-collective/tennis/actions/workflows/pages-deploy.yml)

This repository contains an automated system for tracking tennis matches and calculating player rankings using the Elo rating system. The entire process is managed through GitHub Issues and Actions, making it easy to use, especially on mobile devices.

## Initial Setup (For New Tennis Leagues)

If you're setting up this system for your own tennis league, follow these one-time configuration steps:

### 1. Fork This Repository

- Click the **"Fork"** button at the top of this repository
- Choose your GitHub account or organization as the destination
- Keep the repository name as "tennis" or rename it for your league

### 2. Configure Repository Settings

After forking, you'll need to configure several settings in your new repository:

#### Enable Issues

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **General**
2. Under "Features", check **"Issues"** to enable them
3. Issues are disabled by default in forks but required for match recording

#### Enable GitHub Actions to Create Pull Requests

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select **"Read and write permissions"**
3. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**

Note: If you forked this under an organization, you need to enable the "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" option for the organization or else the organization's setting will override the repository setting.

#### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. This allows the automated workflows to deploy your leaderboard

### 3. Create Required Labels

Create these labels in your repository (**Issues** â†’ **Labels** â†’ **New label**):

- **`new-match`** (color: #0E8A16) - Used by the issue template to trigger match processing
- **`ranking-update`** (color: #0052CC) - Applied to automated ranking update pull requests

### 4. Add Your Players

Edit the `players.yml` file to include the GitHub usernames of all players in your league (you can delete the example players):

```yaml
- github-username-of-player-1
- github-username-of-player-2
- ...
```

### 5. Update the README Links

Update the live leaderboard link in this README to point to your deployment:

## How to Record a Match

Follow these simple steps to record a match and have the rankings updated automatically.

1. **Open the Issue Form**: Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository, click the **"New issue"** button, and select **"ðŸŽ¾ Record a match"** from the template.
2. **Fill in the Details**:
    - **Title**: Do what you will.
    - **Match date**: The date the match was played (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
    - **Players**: The GitHub handles of the two players, separated by a comma. The first listed is Player 1, the second is Player 2 (e.g., `@player1, @player2`).
    - **Sets**: The score of each set, one per line. The first number is Player 1's games; the second is Player 2's games (e.g., `6-3`).
3. **Submit the Issue**: Click "Submit new issue".
4. **Review and Approve the PR**: A bot will create a pull request (PR) with the match data and link to this PR from the issue. The two players involved will be requested to review it.
5. **Merge the PR**: Once the PR is approved, it can be merged. On merge an action will be triggered that will update the rankings.csv file.
6. **Merge the PR**: Another PR will be opened that will update the rankings.csv file. You will need to merge this PR as well. Upon merge the leaderboard will be updated.

## Terminology and Rules

This section defines core terms and documents the current behavior so contributors and players share the same mental model.

- **Match**: A single github issue representing one play "session" or match. A match will contain some number of sets.
- **Set**: A line in the issueâ€™s Sets block, e.g., `6-4`. The winner is the side with the higher games on that line.
- **Game**: The tennis unit within a set.

### Current ELO behavior

- Ratings are based on individual sets. If a Match contains multiple sets, each set contributes an ELO update independently.
- Score margin (e.g., 6â€‘0 vs 6â€‘5) does not change the ELO delta; only who won the set matters.
- Player rankings are calculated using the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).
